This demo is similar to [Repeat2](../Repeat2) but it uses Redis for task records instead of CLIXML files.
This requires [FarNet.Redis](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/FarNet.Redis).

[Repeat.tasks.ps1](Repeat.tasks.ps1) defines `repeat` parameters.
It is designed for using in any build script, not just this demo.

The build script [Repeat.build.ps1](Repeat.build.ps1) shows repeat-tasks.

See also [Repeat](../Repeat).
